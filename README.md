# save_javascript_webpage_as_html
An example of using the headless browser Puppeteer to save a dynamic Javascript page as HTML.

I am using a local version of the jstack-review website as my example web page. Just clone their repo (https://github.com/jstack-review/jstack-review) to get the index.html referenced in my example.js.
